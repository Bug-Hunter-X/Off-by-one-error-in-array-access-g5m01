This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays.  The bug.java file contains the erroneous code.  The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected version.  This is a classic example of a subtle bug that can be difficult to detect. The error arises from using `<=` instead of `<` in the loop condition, causing an attempt to access an index that does not exist.
